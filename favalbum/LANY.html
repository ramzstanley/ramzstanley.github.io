					Late night
					<br>Your eyes fell to the floor
					<br>I'm trying to make sense
					<br>But you're losing your patience
					<br>Hands talk, won't stop
					<br>We go to war
					<br>In the heat of the moment
					<br>You think that we're broken
					<br>
					<br>I could see my whole life with you baby
					<br>Now you got me thinking that I'm crazy
					<br>Cause you're...
					<br>
					<br>Out the door
					<br>Just one mistake
					<br>You say you're not in love no more
					<br>But was it really love
					<br>If you can leave me for
					<br>Something so innocent
					<br>Is this the end?
					<br>Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
					<br>
					<br>Can't sleep, can't eat
					<br>My mind's a mess
					<br>What are you thinking?
					<br>You were happy last weekend
					<br>All the good times
					<br>How'd you forget?
					<br>I was your best friend, yeah
					<br>Remember when you said
					<br>
					<br>You could see your whole life with me baby
					<br>Now you got me thinking that I'm crazy
					<br>Cause you're...
					<br>
					<br>Out the door
					<br>Just one mistake
					<br>You say you're not in love no more
					<br>But was it really love
					<br>If you can leave me for
					<br>Something so innocent
					<br>Is this the end?
					<br>Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
					<br>Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
					<br>Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
					<br>Thought you'd be there through thick and thin
					<br>
					<br>Said you'd be there for me through everything
					<br>Said that you'd have my back with anything
					<br>Said you'd be there for me through everything
					<br>Said that you'd have my back with anything
					<br>
					<br>Now you're out the door
					<br>Just one mistake
					<br>You say you're not in love no more
					<br>But was it really love
					<br>If you can leave me for
					<br>Something so innocent
					<br>Is this the end?
					<br>Thought you'd be there through thick and thin

					<br>Said that you'd have my back with anything
