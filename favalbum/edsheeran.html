			<h2> Lego House </h2>
			<p>
			I'm gonna pick up the pieces
			<br>And build a Lego house
			<br>When things go wrong we can knock it down
			<br>My three words have two meanings
			<br>There's one thing on my mind, it's all for you
			<br>
			<br>And it's dark in a cold December
			<br>But I've got ya to keep me warm
			<br>And if you're broken I'll mend ya
			<br>And I keep you sheltered from the storm
			<br>That's raging on now
			<br>
			<br>I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
			<br>I'll pick you up when you're getting down
			<br>And out of all these things I've done
			<br>I think I love you better now
			<br>
			<br>I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
			<br>I'll do it all for you in time
			<br>And out of all these things I've done
			<br>I think I love you better now, now
			<br>
			<br>I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in
			<br>If things go right we can frame it
			<br>And put you on a wall

			<br>And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
			<br>Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

			<br>I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
			<br>I'll pick you up when you're getting down
			<br>And out of all these things I've done
			<br>I think I love you better now
			<br>
			<br>I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
			<br>I'll do it all for you in time
			<br>And out of all these things I've done
			<br>I think I love you better now
			<br>
			<br>Don't hold me down
			<br>I think my braces are breaking
			<br>And it's more than I can take
			<br>
			<br>And it's dark in a cold December
			<br>But I've got ya to keep me warm
			<br>If you're broken I will mend ya
			<br>And I keep you sheltered from the storm
			<br>That's raging on now
			<br>
			<br>I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
			<br>I'll pick you up when you're getting down
			<br>And out of all these things I've done
			<br>I think I love you better now
			<br>
			<br>I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
			<br>I'll do it all for you in time
			<br>And out of all these things I've done
			<br>I think I love you better now
			<br>
			<br>I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
			<br>I'll pick you up when you're getting down
			<br>And out of all these things I've done
			<br>I will love you better now
